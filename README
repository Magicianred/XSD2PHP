An XML schema to PHP class generator
Released under the GPL, see COPYING
I offer no guarentees, either express or implied, that this software
and the classes it generates are fit for use. Use at own risk.

Usage: php xsd2php.php <schema.xml>

Will result in a number of classes being created in the current directory.
Each class has the following features
- list of properties representing xml children
- constructor which validate the children based upon type, and number
  of occurances.
- Doc comments for the constructor
- validates against the PHPCodeSniffer PEAR coding standard check.

TODO: Change to use the DOM instead of simpleXML
